## Install

```sh
npm install dipress
```

## Description

Dipress is a TypeScript decorator library built on top of Express. The primary motivation behind the library is to allow developers to create Node.js server-side applications using SOLID principles, taking an OOP approach, while making full use of the advantages offered by TypeScript decorators. It offers work-arounds for some of the common problems that arise while making APIs using Express, like a lack of structure and the absence of strict data-types for Data Transfer Objects.
