> A TypeScript decorator library built on top of express.js

### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/AntoRin/express-frills)

## Install

```sh
npm install express-frills
```

## Usage

> Create an express server using TypeScript decorators.

Use the @ApplicationServer decorator for your main server class, and get your express server initialized behind the scenes. Following that, you can use an @RestController class decorator to initialize API routes (if it is the same class as your main application server, make sure @RestController comes second), and each method in that class can be an API endpoint, considering which of the available method decorators like @GET, @POST, @PUT, etc., you use.

## Decorators

```ts
@ApplicationServer(app?: Express.Application)
```

### Initialize express server. You can either pass in your app with all the basic middlewares like cors, body-parser, etc., or have a basic app created for you.

---

```ts
@RestController(routePrefix?: string)
```

### Initialize your controller, either with or without a route prefix.

---

```ts
@UseMiddlewares(middlewares: Array<Function>)
```

### Initialize middlewares like "requireAuth" for your controller.

---

```ts
@GET(path: string)
@POST(path: string)
@PUT(path: string)
@DELETE(path: string)
```

### Rest methods for your endpoint controller methods.

---

```ts
@PreRouteHandlers(handlers: Array<Function>)
@PostRouteHandlers(handlers: Array<Function>)
```

### Handlers for before and after the request hits your endpoint.

---

```ts
@Factory
```

### Return an array of handlers within your endpoint method.
